# REQ — receipts track a spawn, not a conversation

## Expected behavior

`RECEIPTS.jsonl` rows are written by the `SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop` hooks,
so a row exists for a subagent *process lifecycle* — not for a verdict, a
conversation, or an amount of work performed. Two consequences follow, and both
are load-bearing for anyone driving the loop:

1. **A verdict without a receipt cannot close a task, however good it is.**
   Ordered hook-owned receipts are the close gate (C-14). Nothing about the
   thoroughness of a lens report changes that.
2. **A receipt pair exists only if the hooks observed both ends.** A start
   without a stop is a live agent — or a dead one that never reported.

## Observed (2026-09-03)

Both of these cost time in one session because neither is written down anywhere.

### Resuming an agent produces no new receipt

`SendMessage` to a finished agent resumes it from its transcript and returns a
final response, but writes no `started` / `completed` pair. A QA lens that
returned FAIL, was resumed after the findings were fixed, and reported PASS
therefore left the receipt trail ending at FAIL. `task_verify` correctly refused.

The symptom is confusing precisely because the work was real: *"QA says PASS but
close keeps refusing."* That is the same surface presentation as the 2026-08-26
stale-hook-tree outage, which is why it is worth naming — the causes are
unrelated and the remedies are opposite.

**Consequence for the loop:** re-verification after fixing review or QA findings
must spawn a fresh lens, not resume the previous one. Resuming is useful for
asking an agent to explain or extend its reasoning; it can never advance the
gate.

### A lens that ends its turn to wait (2026-09-26)

A qa-cli lens ran the full suite as a background command and ended its turn to
wait for it. That turn end fired `SubagentStop`, and its interim text ("the
suite is still running") was recorded as the lens's `completed` row with
verdict `PENDING`. The completion notification then resumed the agent:

- its second `SubagentStart` for the same agent id used to raise
  `duplicate or conflicting Claude lifecycle start`, logged as a `gate-crash`;
- its real final (`PASS`) could not replace the recorded completion, and was
  reported as a retryable publication failure that nothing would retry.

The first turn end is the completion; that does not change (see "Why this is a
REQ" below). What changed:

- **Prevention.** The Claude lens agents (`code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`,
  `qa-cli`, `qa-api`, `qa-browser`, `qa-desktop`) are told to run verification
  commands in the foreground and never end a turn while their own command or
  subagent is still running. In the two reviewers the rule sits outside the
  role core, so the Claude/Codex core parity is unchanged.
- **Naming.** A second start after a recorded completion writes nothing and
  logs a `background_hook:binding-miss` breadcrumb with
  `provenance_reason=resumed-after-completion`. A later, different final writes
  nothing and logs `provenance_reason=completion-already-recorded`. These are
  expected refusals, not binding failures, even though the breadcrumb text reads
  "produced no receipt". Any other conflicting start still raises.

The 2026-09-03 "resume writes no pair" observation above is very likely this
same mechanism; it now surfaces as these two reasons instead of a crash.

**Remedy:** spawn the lens fresh. `task_verify`'s "Recorded but unusable" next
action already says so, but its stated cause (a misplaced verdict block) and the
`receipts:verdict-unbound` breadcrumb's remedy ("re-deliver … with exactly one
verdict block") misname this case; a follow-up child of
GOAL__2026-09-26-0-setup-execution-5aef74d0 gives it its own cause.

Verification: `tests/test_subagent_lifecycle.py`
(`test_a_resumed_lens_is_named_and_cannot_replace_its_completion`,
`test_a_resume_with_a_different_agent_type_still_raises`,
`test_background_hook_names_a_resumed_lens_without_a_gate_crash`) and
`tests/test_feedback_rule_skill_docs.py::test_claude_lens_agents_stay_in_the_foreground`.

### Killing an agent leaves an orphan `started` row

Stopping a running subagent leaves its `started` row with no completion. The
stop gate (removed 2026-09-23; historical) read those rows as live background work and reported the agent as
still active — in one observed case for ~1450 seconds after it had been killed —
until `HARNESS_BACKGROUND_STALE_SECS` (default 1800) ages it out.

Nothing is corrupted and the gate degrades safely: `subagent_lifecycle`'s stale
handling is exactly why the row eventually stops counting. But between the kill
and the timeout, "background work still running" names a process that no longer
exists.

**Consequence for the loop:** after killing a lens, expect the gate to mention
it for a while. Do not interpret it as a second agent still running, and do not
try to clear it by hand — `RECEIPTS.jsonl` is hook-owned (C-05), and a
hand-written or hand-deleted row is exactly what the receipt protocol exists to
prevent.

## Why this is a REQ and not a code change

Neither behaviour is wrong. Receipts describing a spawn is the property that
makes them unforgeable; if a resume could append a completion, a coordinator
could manufacture one. The stale-timeout path is the fail-safe design working.

What was missing is the written expectation, so the observable behaviour reads
as a defect the first time it is met. If a future task does change this — for
instance by writing a cancellation row when an agent is killed — that row must
still come from a lifecycle hook observing the event, never from the caller.

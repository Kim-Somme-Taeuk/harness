# REQ — subagent completion receipts survive runtime transcript shape

tags: [harness, receipts, verification]
summary: A subagent that completes normally must always produce a `completed` receipt; provenance tolerates duplicate hook attachments but never forgeries.
updated: 2026-09-25

## Expected normal behavior

When a harness subagent (reviewer, QA lens, or any lifecycle-tracked agent)
finishes on a task run:

1. `RECEIPTS.jsonl` contains an ordered `started` → `completed` pair for that
   agent's `runtime_id`, bound to the current `task_run_id`.
2. `task_verify` can therefore reach a receipt-backed `runtime_verdict: PASS`
   once required review lenses PASS before required QA lenses.
3. `task_close` succeeds on a standard task whose lenses have all completed.

If any of these does not hold for an agent that visibly ran and returned a final
response, the harness is defective — not the agent.

## Transcript provenance requirements

`_trusted_stop_provenance` in `plugin/scripts/subagent_lifecycle.py` derives the
completion's authority from the subagent transcript. It must:

- Take the agent type from exactly one source, in this order:
  1. The **canonical** attachment (`hookName == "SubagentStart"`, content a
     one-element list matching `Agent <type> started (<agent_id>)`). Identical
     repeats are one start; two different agent types are a hard failure.
  2. Only when no canonical attachment exists, the **matcher-qualified**
     attachment (`hookName == "SubagentStart:<type>"`). The suffix is the
     type, and that line must carry this `agentId` and post-date the run
     start. Different suffixes are a hard failure.
  3. Only when the transcript has neither, the single hook-owned `started`
     receipt for this runtime and run (§ "No start attachment at all").
- While a canonical attachment is present, **tolerate** matcher-qualified
  attachments beside it. Claude 2.1.x emits one per matched hook, with empty
  content, *before* the canonical attachment. Skip them then, and take no
  agent type, timestamp authority, or completion identity from them.
- **Reject** any other `hookName` under that `hookEvent`, and reject any
  transcript item whose `agentId` or `sessionId` names someone other than the
  stopping agent and session. That guard is loop-wide and applies to qualified
  attachments too.
- Treat a qualified attachment's *own* fields as non-load-bearing. Its
  `agentId` may be absent, and its `content`/`stdout` may repeat or even
  contradict the identity string; none of it is read. Requiring any field of a
  line the validator otherwise ignores would recreate the coupling that caused
  the 2026-08-25 outage.
- Keep every existing path, ownership, `nlink`, mtime-stability, session-marker,
  and run-id check unchanged. Tolerance applies only to duplicate hook
  bookkeeping, never to identity.

Together these establish the property that matters: **a real subagent of the
recorded type actually started in this task run.** That is what makes a
completion receipt something the orchestrator cannot simply assert.

## No start attachment at all

Both attachment shapes above come from other plugins' `SubagentStart` output
(oh-my-claudecode). The harness start hook prints none. On an install with only
the harness plugin, a subagent transcript has **zero** `SubagentStart`
attachments. Observed 2026-09-25 (Claude Code 2.1.282): all 8 stops in one
session were declined at `no-canonical-start-attachment`, even though the
harness `SubagentStart` hook had written a `started` receipt for each. No
completion was ever written, so `task_verify` could not reach PASS on any task.

When the transcript has no start attachment of either shape, provenance binds
the stop to the agent type recorded in the **single hook-owned `started`
receipt** (`source: claude_hook`) for this exact `runtime_id`
(`claude:<session>:<agent>`) and the current `task_run_id`. Everything else
still holds:

- official session and agent identity, the session→task binding, the
  transcript path shape, ownership, permissions, `nlink` and a stable read;
- every transcript line must belong to this agent and session;
- a present start attachment always wins, and one that conflicts with the
  start receipt fails closed (`receipt_pending`); a malformed `SubagentStart:`
  name still rejects with `unrecognized-start-hook-name`;
- zero or several matching start receipts, a start receipt from an earlier
  run, or one from another source give no fallback, and the stop is rejected
  with `no-canonical-start-attachment` as before;
- if the stop payload names a different supported lens than the start receipt,
  the stop is rejected with `hook-start-agent-type-mismatch`; a payload with
  no agent type is accepted;
- stop-only runtimes, which have no start receipt, still need a transcript
  attachment (C-14).

This does not widen the trust boundary. `RECEIPTS.jsonl` is guarded against
Write/Edit but not against Bash. A shell writer can already append a
`completed` row directly, which is outside the integrity boundary. A forged
`started` row would only unlock a completion whose verdict still comes from the
runtime stop payload.

Verification: `tests/test_subagent_lifecycle.py`. The attachment-less tests
cover the fallback, the stop-only refusal, a prior-run start, a lens mismatch,
a payload without a type, replay, attachment precedence, the malformed name,
and a `background_hook.py` end-to-end run. The `_hook_start_agent_type` test
includes the `MappingProxyType` snapshot entries.

## What provenance deliberately does not check

Provenance does **not** compare the transcript's final assistant text against
the payload's `last_assistant_message`, and must not be "hardened" to do so.

The runtime appends that text around the same instant `SubagentStop` fires, so
a hook reading immediately sees a trailing `thinking`/`tool_use` record (empty
extracted text) or no file at all. Requiring a match rejected genuine stops
roughly as often as it passed them — during the 2026-08-25 session only one of
five real lens agents produced a receipt.

What the check bought was resistance to a deliberate multi-step forgery: spawn
one trivial subagent so a genuine transcript and `started` receipt exist, then
replay a hand-written payload claiming `VERDICT: PASS` against that same session
and agent id. That is not the failure mode receipts exist for. Receipts guard
against an orchestrator *confabulating* that a review happened — not against one
deliberately staging a decoy and hand-crafting hook input. An agent able to do
the latter can also fabricate the transcript outright, so the check was not a
real boundary either.

A sharper form of the same gap: a crafted stop delivered against a genuine,
still-running lens agent would write `completed` before the real stop arrives,
and the real stop then degrades to `receipt_pending` — so a real reviewer's FAIL
would never land. Both variants require hand-crafted input to
`background_hook.py`. Bash/shell mutation and direct lifecycle-script
invocation are outside Harness PreToolUse enforcement, so this is an explicitly
accepted hostile-shell exposure rather than a receipt-model boundary.

Restoring it would require either a retry loop inside the stop hook or a
deferred-reconciliation state machine, plus a raised hook timeout. That is a
large, permanently-load-bearing apparatus bought for a threat model that does
not apply. The verdict comes from the runtime-supplied payload, which the
orchestrator cannot author.

## Not every stop owes a receipt

Agent classes other than lifecycle-tracked lenses stop without writing a
subagent transcript and without a `started` receipt. They owe no completion,
and reporting them as binding misses buries real failures — during the
2026-08-25 diagnosis roughly 25 such entries masked the single entry that
mattered. A miss is logged when a matching `started` receipt exists for the
run, or when the payload names an agent type; otherwise silence is correct.

## Fail-closed property

A provenance regression must block close, never fabricate a PASS. This is the
system's most important safety property and the reason the 2026-08-25 defect was
recoverable: the bug suppressed every completion receipt, so tasks became
unclosable rather than falsely closing. Any future change that makes provenance
failure produce a PASS — or that lets a `completed` receipt be written without a
verified transcript — is a strictly worse failure than the outage it prevents.

Because the failure is silent by construction, `background_hook.py` logs a
`background_hook:binding-miss` entry to `doc/harness/learnings.jsonl` whenever a
subagent stops without producing a receipt **that was owed** — see "Not every
stop owes a receipt" above for exactly when that is. That breadcrumb is the
intended diagnostic entry point; preserve it, and preserve its narrowing.

## Test obligation

Fixtures must reproduce the **runtime** transcript shape, including the
matcher-qualified duplicate with its real field set (`type: "hook_success"`,
`stdout`, `exitCode`, `toolUseID`, …) rather than a stylized approximation. The 2026-08-25 defect passed 827 tests because
`tests/test_subagent_lifecycle.py` emitted only the canonical attachment. A
green unit suite is not evidence that receipts work end to end; a live
spawn-and-verify pass is.

## History

- **2026-08-25** — the canonical-`hookName` check in `_trusted_stop_provenance`
  hard-failed on the
  matcher-qualified `SubagentStart:<agent-type>` attachment that Claude 2.1.220
  writes first. No subagent could record a completion, so `task_verify` never
  reached PASS and no standard task could close; four tasks were stranded open.
  Diagnosed from the `binding-miss` breadcrumbs.
- The same session had an approved plan to delete the receipt subsystem
  outright (`TASK__remove-receipt-system`), on the premise that the verification
  gate was not earning its complexity. That plan was **cancelled** once the
  cause was shown to be this one-line provenance bug rather than a design
  failure. Independent receipt-backed verification is retained deliberately;
  reversing it again should require new evidence, not a repeat of this outage.

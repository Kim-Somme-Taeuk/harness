"""Prompt-contract tests for the batch integration `review-code` carry rule.

The post-wave `harness:batch` integration task carries a lead range that its
own lead already reviewed and QA'd when rebase plus fast-forward is proven
patch-equivalent, and selects review depth over the residual only. Selection
is orchestration instruction, not lifecycle code, so these tests pin the
wording relations in the pipeline, the Claude reviewer, and the REQ.

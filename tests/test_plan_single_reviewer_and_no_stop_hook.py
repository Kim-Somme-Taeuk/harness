"""Plan review runs one independent reviewer; Claude registers no Stop hook.

User request 2026-09-23 (TASK__plan-single-voice-review):
- Historical full reviews showed the second plan voice almost never changed a
  decision, and Phase 1 Voice B reran the identical prompt on same-model
  transport. Each full review phase now spawns one independent reviewer
  subagent; the cross-model transport, consensus table and dual-voice
  degradation matrix are gone from both runtimes.
- The Claude Stop hook turned every wait on a background reviewer into repeated
  "Do not stop" turns. Continuation is native /goal; completion is still gated
  by task_close.

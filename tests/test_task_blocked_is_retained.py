"""task_blocked stays as the park record; docs no longer describe a live stop gate.

User decision 2026-09-25 (TASK__remove-blocked-env-pause-path, re-scoped):
the 2026-09-02 plan to delete task_blocked / BLOCKED.md was withdrawn after the
Claude Stop hook was intentionally removed on 2026-09-23. With no turn-end gate
left, task_blocked only records an unfinished task. See
doc/harness/REQ__task-blocked-is-the-park-record.md.
